# METHOD could be:
# SMC2: SOPF, BSMC, adPMCMC

### Models and datasets options
# MODEL is a string, there has to be files named MODELx.py and MODELtheta.py
# in the models/ subfolder. Provided models are: 
# - simplestmodel: most basic linear gaussian SSM
# - locallevel: basic linear gaussian SSM
# - thetalogistic: population model with non linear hidden process (Polansky's parameterization)
# - periodic: highly non linear model from Gordon Salmond and Smith
# - SVonefactor: SV stands for stochastic volatility. This model is the one factor model.
# - SVfixedrho: this one is the two factor model without leverage (rho_1 = rho_2 = 0)
# - SVmultifactor: this one is the two factor model with leverage
# - athletics: SSM with GEV observation function, to model the best times in athletics.
# T: number of observations to be taken into account
# DATASET could either be a string corresponding to a file named
# DATASET.R in the data/ subfolder, or "synthetic", in which case
# data points are simulated from the model.
# Provided datasets are:
# - "SP500recent": 753 data points from the S&P500 index. You can test the
# nonlinear SV model on this data set.
# - "anisus" (18 data points), or "nutria" (120 data points). You can test these datasets
# with the thetalogistic model.
# - "athletics-best-two": (for the athletics records model), taken from http://www.alltime-athletics.com/
##########################
### SMC2 algorithm parameters
# NTHETA: number of theta-particles
# NX: number of x-particles 
# DYNAMICNX: automatic increase of NX:
# PROPOSALKERNEL can be either "randomwalk" or "independent".
# ESSTHRESHOLD: resample-move steps are triggered when the ESS goes below ESSTHRESHOLD.
##########################
### Advanced parameters for SMC2
## DYNAMICNXTHRESHOLD: If DYNAMICNX, acceptance rate limit
## NXLIMIT: If DYNAMICNX, maximum number of x-particles allowed
## If PROPOSALKERNEL == "randomwalk",
## the random walk has variance RWVARIANCE * Cov(theta-particles).
# NBMOVES: Number of moves to perform at each resample-move step
##########################
### SOPF algorithm parameters
# NSOPF: If you want to try the SOPF algorithm to compare the results,
# specify the number of particles here
##########################
### BSMC algorithm parameters
# NBSMC: If you want to try the BSMC algorithm to compare the results,
# specify the number of particles here
# BSMCsmooth: specify the "h" factor used in the kernel density approximation
# of the distribution of the parameters given the data
# should be "slowly decreasing with N", N being the number of particles
##########################
### adaptive PMCMC algorithm parameters
# If you want to try the adaptive PMCMC algorithm to compare the results:
# NPMCMC: Number of x-particles
# TPMCMC: Number of iterations
# PMCMCBURNIN: burn-in (for the plots only)
##########################
### Plot options
# GENERATERFILE: Generate R file to plot results (does not require R)
## PLOT: Generate pdf figures using the R file (requires R and package "ggplot2")
##########################
### Results options
# Specify time at which the theta-particles should be saved
# (useful when doing sequential analysis).
# The final time T = number of observations is automatically saved,
# no need to add it to the list.
### : Should the program report profiling? (Slows the program a little bit).
# RESULTSFILENAME: Specify results file name (without extensions),
# leave empty if an automatic name is preferred, based on the algorithm parameters.
# REPLACEFILE: Replace already existing files; if False,
# a counter will be added to the result file name, so that no existing files are erased.
# USESUBFOLDERS: Use subfolders for each model and each dataset to organize the results.
# If False, use long names and store the results at the root of the results/ folder.
# RESULTSFILETYPE could include "RData" and "cpickle".
# This list is used to save the results either in RData format 
# or in cPickle format or in both formats. RData is required to use the graph programs
# of subfolder rgraphs/.
#RESULTSFILETYPE = ["RData", "cpickle"]
